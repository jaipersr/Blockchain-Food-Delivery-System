This code serves as an introduction to distributed AI/multiagent theories and techniques and studying their role in designing next generation blockchain applications. Topics include algorithms for agent interaction in cooperative and competitive environments, the role of coordination and promoting cooperative behaviors in large-scale distributed networks and the internet economy, consensus formation and negotiation in distributed systems, smart contracts, public vs private blockchains, cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures. In addition to programming assignments, these techniques will be used to implement a blockchain application where a trusted environment for all transactions is essential.
